"Proposal concerns a Hypercore-based storage system with incentivisation to ensure content availability. 
The problem at hand is a hard problem, and the proposal does not convincingly argue why this proposal would work whether other efforts struggle.
The comparison with similar efforts includes only Hypercore-related (and even more specifically, Beaker-related) projects, 
lacking any mention of e.g. Filecoin and others. 
The incentivisation system for storage providers seems complex and unproven, 
and would thus need thorough research to avoid failing or being gamed and leading to data loss. 
In that light, it is not surprising that while the project has existed for several years, 
with some prior funding, it remains in a pre-alpha stage. 
Project appears well-connected with, and possibly usable by, other projects in hypercore ecosystem. 
Being tightly knit into this stack, it seems unlikely to be usable beyond it (or to reuse technology from outside it); 
although a successful result within this ecosystem would also be a worthwhile result."
